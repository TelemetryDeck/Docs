## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have already created a TelemetryDeck account. If you haven't yet, please [sign up now](https://dashboard.telemetrydeck.com/register)!

## Installing the Swift Package

The TelemetryDeck Swift package uses Swift Package Manager.

1. Open Xcode and navigate to the project you want to add TelemetryDeck to
1. In the menu, select <kbd>File</kbd> -> <kbd>Add Packages...</kbd>. This will open the Swift Package Manager view
1. Paste `https://github.com/TelemetryDeck/SwiftSDK` into the search field.
1. Select the `SwiftSDK` package that appears in the list
1. Set the <kbd>Dependency Rule</kbd> to <kbd>Up to Next Major Version</kbd>
1. Press <kbd>Add Package</kbd> to continue

This will include the TelemetryDeck Swift SDK into your app by downloading the source code. Feel free to browse the client's source code, it's tiny and you'll see for yourself how TelemetryDeck is hashing user identifiers before they ever reach the server. Privacy, yay!

## Including the package in your target

Xcode will ask you to link the package with your target in the next screen, titled <kbd>Choose Package Products for SwiftSDK</kbd>. Set the <kbd>Add to target</kbd> column to your app target for <kbd>TelemetryDeck</kbd> (not "TelemetryClient", which is deprecated) and click <kbd>Add Package</kbd> to complete the integration.

{% noteinfo "Link Library with more than one Target" %}

In case Xcode forgets to ask you to link the library with your target, you can do so manually by selecting your target in the project navigator and selecting the <kbd>Build Phases</kbd> tab. Click the <kbd>+</kbd> button in the <kbd>Link Binary With Libraries</kbd> section and select the `TelemetryDeck` library.
{% endnoteinfo %}

## Initializing the TelemetryDeck Swift Package

The `TelemetryDeck` package will provide you with a class `TelemetryDeck` that you'll use for all interactions with TelemetryDeck. Before you can use that class, you'll need to initialize it at the start of your app. We strongly recommend doing so as soon as possible, as you won't be able to send Signals before the `TelemetryDeck` is initialized.

This is slightly different depending on whether you use SwiftUI or UIKit's `AppDelegate` to manage your app's lifecycle, so let's look at these individually.

{% noteinfo "You need your app's Unique Identifier" %}
TelemetryDeck assigns a unique identifier to your app, and you need to hand that identifier to the TelemetryDeck SDK.

Use the [TelemetryDeck Dashboard](https://dashboard.telemetrydeck.com) to create a new app and copy its unique identifier into your computer's clipboard.
{% endnoteinfo %}

You only need **one** way of initializing the TelemetryDeck SDK, either SwiftUI/SceneKit or AppDelegate. If your app is new, you'll likely want to use SwiftUI/SceneKit.

### Initialization with SwiftUI

For Scene-based SwiftUI applications, we recommend adding the initialization to your `@main` App struct! Open `YourAppNameApp.swift` and look for code that looks like this:

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct YourAppNameApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

This is the entry point to your app. Now let's add the initialization here.

Import the TelemetryDeck Package by adding `import TelemetryDeck`. Then add an `init()` method to your App struct that creates a `TelemetryDeck.Config` instance and hands it to `TelemetryDeck.initialize(config:)`, using the **Unique Identifier of your app** that you copied into your clipboard earlier. If you don't have that anymore, you can get it at any time from the TelemetryDeck Dashboard.

Your code should now look like this:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import TelemetryDeck

@main
struct YourAppNameApp: App {
    init() {
        let config = TelemetryDeck.Config(appID: "YOUR-APP-ID")
        TelemetryDeck.initialize(config: config)
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

If you prefer to have it on a single line, you can also write:

```swift
TelemetryDeck.initialize(config: .init(appID: "YOUR-APP-ID"))
```

Your app is now ready to use TelemetryDeck. You can skip the next section which explains setup for UIKit-based apps.

### Initialization in an AppDelegate based app

If you use `AppDelegate` to manage your app's life cycle, open the file `AppDelegate.swift` and look for the method `application(:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`. It will probably look similar to this:

```swift
import UIKit

@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        return true
    }

    // ...
}
```

By default, Xcode even adds a comment here to tell you where to add stuff that should happen right after launch.

Now, import the `TelemetryDeck` package and configure the `TelemetryDeck` using the **Unique Identifier of your app** that you copied into your clipboard earlier. If you don't have that anymore you can get it at any time from the TelemetryDeck Dashboard.

```swift
import UIKit
import TelemetryDeck

@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        let config = TelemetryDeck.Config(appID: "YOUR-APP-ID")
        TelemetryDeck.initialize(config: config)

        return true
    }
    // ...
}
```

You are now ready to send signals!

## Sending signals

Let's send a signal to show the app has launched correctly.

{% noteinfo "What is a signal?" %}

Signals are an indication that **an event** happened in your app, which is used by a **user**. Signals consist of these parts:

- **Signal Name** â€“Â A string that indicates which kind of event happened
- **User Identifier** â€“Â A string that identifies your user (we auto-generate one for you)
- **Optional Parameters** â€“ A dictionary of additional data about your app or the event triggering the signal

See the [Signals Reference](/docs/api/signals-reference/) for more information about how you can effectively use Signals.
{% endnoteinfo %}

{% notewarning "When running from Xcode, you're sending test signals" %}

If your app is built in `DEBUG` configuration (i.e. running from Xcode), your signals will be tagged as **Test Signals**, meaning that you can easily filter them out later. You'll see them show up in the TelemetryDeck Dashboard when the **Test Mode** toggle in the sidebar is turned on.
{% endnotewarning %}

The default way to set a user identifier is `TelemetryDeck.updateDefaultUserID`. This way you only have to set it once, or when it changes, such as user login.
See the [TelemetryDeck SDK's `README.md` file](https://github.com/TelemetryDeck/SwiftSDK/blob/main/README.md) for more information on how to send signals.

{% noteinfo "Best practice:" %}
You can also set a user identifier per send call as shown below, but this is not usually necessary.
{% endnoteinfo %}

Let's just send one signal that tells us the app has launched. Go to the place where you just added the initialization, and directly below add another line:

```swift
let config = TelemetryDeck.Config(appID: "YOUR-APP-ID")
TelemetryDeck.initialize(config: config)

TelemetryDeck.signal("App.launched")
```

And done. This is all you need to send a signal. You do not need to keep an instance of TelemetryDeck and hand it around, just call the static `signal` function on the class directly. If you want to add a custom user identifier or metadata payload, add them to the function call like this:

```swift
TelemetryDeck.signal(
    "App.launched",
    parameters: [
        "numberOfTimesPizzaModeHasActivated": "\(dataStore.pizzaMode.count)",
        "pizzaCheeseMode": "\(dataStore.pizzaCheeseMode)"
    ],
    customUserID: "my.very.cool@user.com"
)
```

{% noteinfo "Privacy Note" %}
The value you pass to `customUserID` will be automatically hashed before being sent to our servers to protect the users privacy. This does not happen for the values in `parameters` though, so hash yourself where needed.
{% endnoteinfo %}

And you're done! You are now sending signals to the TelemetryDeck server. ðŸŽ‰

Run your app and confirm that your first signal arrived in the "Recent Signals" tab on TelemetryDeck. Don't forget to turn on "Test Mode" to see signals sent in debug builds!

## Fill out Apple's app privacy details

Something you need to do before you can upload your app to the App Store is going through Apple's privacy details on App Store Connect. This informs your users about what data is collected, and how it is collected.

Although TelemetryDeck is privacy friendly, as we only handle not personally identifiable information, you still need to click through the privacy details.

We have a [handy guide](/docs/articles/apple-app-privacy/) where we go over each step that is required.

## Privacy Policy and Opt-Out

You don't need to update your privacy policy, [but we recommend you do it anyway](/docs/guides/privacy-faq/#do-i-need-to-add-telemetrydeck-to-my-privacy-policy%3F).

## You're all set!

You can now send signals! Don't overdo it in the beginning. It's okay if you only send **one** signal, named `App.launched`. This will already give you number of users, number of launches, system versions, retention, and more!

After a while, you can add a signal for each screen in your app, so you can see which screens your users use most. It's also recommended to add all your custom settings to your metadata each time. This way you can see which settings most of your users use.
