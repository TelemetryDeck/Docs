Follow these steps to get an insight of your monthly active users within a couple of minutes:

1. Go to the dashboard of your choice and create a New Insight.

2. In the next step select "I donâ€™t know, show me some examples" and then choose "Monthly Users".

3. Unfortunately, you probably still do not find the chart really that helpful as most likely only data of the last 30 days is included and that contradicts a bit a chart with granularity "Month".

A quick fix is changing the included data from "Last 30 Days" to "This Year" in the respective dropdown at the top of the page.

4. An issue is that you do not want to constantly change the time interval manually every time you use TelemetryDeck for this query to work. To resolve this:
- While editing the query click on the "Query Type" button and choose "Advanced Query". This will cause that you stop editing the query, but once you click on "Edit" that same query again you can now use the Visual Editor.
- In the Metadata section add an item for Relative Intervals
- At beginningDate choose "month", "-12" and "beginning" to start the time interval 12 months ago and at endDate choose "month", "0" and "end" to end the time interval at the current time

The query is now working as required although the dropdown at the top is changed back to "Last 30 Days".
