A Top N query allows you to list the top N values of a dimension, ordered by a metric. For example, you can list the top 10 versions of your app by number of users.

## Example

```json
{
  "aggregations": [{ "name": "count", "type": "count" }],
  "dataSource": "telemetry-signals",
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "appVersion",
      "outputName": "appVersion",
      "type": "default"
    }
  ],
  "granularity": "all",
  "metric": {
    "ordering": "version",
    "type": "dimension"
  },
  "filter": {
    "dimension": "appID",
    "type": "selector",
    "value": "AAABBBCCC"
  },
  "queryType": "topN",
  "threshold": 10
}
```
